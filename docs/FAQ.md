# Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this legal?
Decompilation exists in a gray area of the law. This is done only for research purposes and has no intent to infringe upon copyright law.

### When will this be complete?
Probably never.

### Will this be ported to X system?
No.

### Will this be playable on a retail PS2?
No, not without significant changes. The game itself uses more memory than a retail PS2 has, not to mention using HOSTFS instead of CDROM0 or other common file systems which the PS2 supports.

### Will this support mods?
No however Splat (which is used to split the binary into object files) can be used to do so at this point though.

### Other questions?
Please make an issue if you need an answer and I will respond and possibly add it here if it makes sense.
